### To test the correlation between ordinal variables 

* The first case is to assume that the ordinal variables are a result of continuously distributed latent factors for which polychoric correlation is suitable. See the link here:- 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychoric_correlation

* The second is a linear by linear correlation test (details to be read) as implemented in the package coin
